# SQL_Project
**Restaurant Order Analysis Using SQL**

This project explores restaurant order data stored in a MySQL database to uncover key insights into menu performance, customer preferences, and ordering patterns.

### Project Goals  
- Evaluate the impact of a newly introduced menu using SQL-based data exploration and analysis.  
- Perform in-depth analysis on two key tables:  
  - `menu_items`: Contains item-level details such as category and pricing.  
  - `order_details`: Tracks all customer orders with timestamps and item references.  

### Key Highlights  
- Designed and executed SQL queries to assess item popularity and category distribution.  
- Identified high- and low-performing menu items by blending order volume with pricing data.  
- Uncovered customer behavior trends and category preferences to inform strategic menu decisions.  
- Demonstrated skills in data modeling (conceptual to physical), data interpretation, and translating raw data into actionable insights.
